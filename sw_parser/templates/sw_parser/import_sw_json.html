        <h1>Import SWProxy JSON</h1>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the latest release of the <a href="https://github.com/lstern/SWProxy-plugins/releases/latest">SWProxy-plugins</a> program.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions provided to capture your Summoner's War account data.</li>
            <li>Find the 1234567-swarfarm.json file and upload it here. The numbers in the filename will be different, but it will end in '-swarfarm.json'</li>
            <li><strong>Optional:</strong> You can import a friend visit data file, which is named 'visit-123456.json'
                <ul>
                    <li>You might want to do this if you can't run SWProxy yourself, but have a friend who can.</li>
                    <li>This data will be imported into the current SWARFARM account.</li>
                    <li>This will not import unequipped rune inventory! This data is only available to the actual account owner, not friends.</li>
                    <li>If you already have runes in your SWARFARM profile inventory, you can choose not to delete them at the import confirmation page.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Things to note:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For your first upload, it is recommended to clear your profile or you will end up with a lot of duplicates. For subsequent uploads your monsters will by synced automatically.</li>
            <li>The upload and processing can take up to about 60 seconds so be patient.</li>
            <li>Please report any issues by leaving feedback <a href="{% url 'feedback:issue_add' %}">here</a>. You can also email your .json file to swarfarm@porksmash.com so I can investigate specific issues.</li>
        </ul>
